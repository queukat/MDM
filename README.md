## Usage

### Text-Based User Interface

To use the text-based user interface, run the `main_v2` function. You will be presented with a menu where you can select various actions to perform on your data.

### Graphical User Interface
To use the graphical user interface, run the `main_gui` function. This will open a graphical interface that provides the same functionality as the text-based interface but with a visual interface.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
tkinter (for the graphical user interface)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install tk
```
